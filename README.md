This project is a simple neural machine translation model that translates German sentences to English using a transformer architecture. The model is trained on custom German-English data and outputs the translated English sentence with a BLEU score to evaluate its translation accuracy.

## Features
- Translation from German to English
- BLEU score for translation quality evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- Other libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) for data processing and evaluation
